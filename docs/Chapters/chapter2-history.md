# Chapter 2: History of Robotics

## Objective

By the end of this chapter, you will understand how robotics evolved from ancient dreams to modern reality. You'll learn about the key inventors, breakthrough moments, and technological leaps that shaped the field. This historical perspective will help you appreciate how far robotics has come and inspire you to imagine where it might go next.

## Concepts

### The Dream of Artificial Life

Humans have imagined creating artificial beings for thousands of years. Ancient Greek myths told of Talos, a bronze giant that protected the island of Crete. Medieval inventors built mechanical clocks with moving figures. These early dreams reflected humanity's fascination with creating life-like machines, though the technology didn't exist to make them truly autonomous.

### From Automation to Intelligence

The journey from simple mechanical devices to modern robots spans centuries. Early "robots" were purely mechanical—clockwork automatons that performed predetermined movements. The industrial revolution brought powered machinery, but these machines still lacked the ability to sense and adapt. True robotics only became possible when three technologies converged: mechanical engineering for physical construction, electronics for control systems, and computer science for programmable intelligence.

### The Birth of the Word "Robot"

The term "robot" first appeared in 1920 in Karel Čapek's play "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots). It came from the Czech word "robota," meaning forced labor. In the play, artificial workers eventually rebel against their human creators—a theme that would echo through science fiction for decades. While Čapek's robots were biological rather than mechanical, the name stuck and came to define the machines we know today.

### Asimov's Laws and the Ethics of Robotics

Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov profoundly influenced how people think about robots. In his 1942 short story "Runaround," he introduced the Three Laws of Robotics: robots must not harm humans, must obey human orders (unless conflicting with the first law), and must protect themselves (unless conflicting with the first two laws). While these laws are fiction, they sparked serious conversations about robot ethics and safety that continue in modern AI research.

## Timeline

### Ancient Times to 1900s: Mechanical Marvels

Long before modern technology, inventors created mechanical wonders. In the 3rd century BCE, Greek engineer Ctesibius built water clocks with moving figures. During the Islamic Golden Age (800-1200 CE), inventor Al-Jazari designed programmable automatons and water-powered machines described in his "Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices." In 18th century Europe, clockmakers like Jacques de Vaucanson built elaborate mechanical figures that could write, play music, and mimic living creatures.

These early automatons weren't robots by our modern definition—they couldn't sense their environment or make decisions—but they demonstrated the human drive to create mechanical life.

### 1920s-1940s: The Concept Takes Shape

The 1920s brought the word "robot" into popular consciousness. The 1939 World's Fair featured Elektro, a humanoid robot built by Westinghouse that could walk, talk (from a record player), and respond to voice commands. While still basically a remote-controlled machine, Elektro captured public imagination and showed what might be possible.

During World War II, innovations in electronics and control systems laid groundwork for true robotics. The development of electronic computers, though primitive by today's standards, finally provided the "brains" that robots would need.

### 1950s-1960s: The First Real Robots

In 1954, George Devol invented the Unimate, the first programmable robot. This wasn't a humanoid walking machine, but an industrial robotic arm. In 1961, General Motors installed the first Unimate on an assembly line, where it performed die casting and welding—dangerous, repetitive tasks perfect for automation. This marked the true beginning of industrial robotics.

Joseph Engelberger, often called the "Father of Robotics," partnered with Devol to commercialize the Unimate through their company Unimation. Engelberger's vision transformed robots from science fiction into practical industrial tools. His work established the robotics industry and proved that robots could work reliably alongside humans in factories.

Meanwhile, research labs began exploring mobile robots. In 1966, the Stanford Research Institute created Shakey, the first mobile robot to reason about its actions. Shakey could navigate rooms, plan routes, and execute complex tasks—primitive by today's standards but revolutionary for its time.

### 1970s-1980s: Robots Go to Work

The 1970s saw robotics spread through manufacturing. Japanese companies embraced industrial robots enthusiastically, using them to improve quality and efficiency. Fanuc, founded by Seiuemon Inaba, became a leading robot manufacturer and pioneered the use of robots to build robots.

In 1979, the Stanford Cart became one of the first autonomous vehicles, successfully navigating a chair-filled room using camera vision—albeit taking five hours to cross the room. These early mobile robots showed both the promise and challenges of autonomous navigation.

The first anthropomorphic robot arm with six degrees of freedom, the Stanford Arm, was developed in the late 1960s and influenced countless designs that followed. By the 1980s, robots could perform delicate assembly work, not just heavy industrial tasks.

### 1990s-2000s: Intelligence and Mobility

The 1990s brought smarter, more adaptable robots. In 1997, NASA's Sojourner rover explored Mars, demonstrating autonomous robotics in the harshest environment imaginable. That same year, IBM's Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, showing that machines could master complex cognitive tasks.

In 2002, iRobot released the Roomba, bringing robots into homes worldwide. While simple compared to industrial robots, the Roomba proved that autonomous robots could be affordable, useful, and user-friendly for average consumers.

Honda's ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility), unveiled in 2000, showcased remarkable humanoid capabilities including walking up stairs, running, and recognizing faces. Though primarily a research platform, ASIMO demonstrated how far humanoid robotics had progressed.

### 2010s-Present: The Robot Revolution

Modern robotics has exploded with diversity and capability. Boston Dynamics' Atlas performs acrobatic backflips, while their Spot robot walks with animal-like agility. Surgical robots like the da Vinci system enable minimally invasive procedures with superhuman precision. Warehouse robots from companies like Amazon Robotics revolutionize logistics by autonomously moving products.

Drones have become commonplace, from hobbyist quadcopters to military reconnaissance platforms. Self-driving car technology, pioneered by researchers like Sebastian Thrun and companies like Waymo, promises to transform transportation. Social robots like SoftBank's Pepper interact with customers in stores and hospitals.

The integration of artificial intelligence with robotics has accelerated dramatically. Machine learning enables robots to improve through experience, recognize objects in complex scenes, and adapt to unexpected situations. Today's robots don't just follow programmed instructions—they learn and evolve.
